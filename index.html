  <h2>The Lion and the Dolphin</h2>
<div class="main-content">
<div class="text-content">
<p> A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the
waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of all
the animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the
king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of
all the inhabitants of the ocean.<br>
The Dolphin gladly consented to this request.<br>
Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him.<br>
The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means
reach the land.</p>
<strong><p>The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin replied,
“Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the
sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the
land.</strong></p>

<h2>The Lion in Love</h2>
<div class="main-content">
<div class="text-content">
<p>A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father,
unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon
this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his
willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one
condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut
off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both.</p>
<p><strong>The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless
Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set
upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.</strong></p></div>m

<h2>The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox</h2>

<p>A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer’s day, fell fast asleep in his
den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers.
He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner
of his den to find the Mouse.</p><p><strong>A Fox seeing him said: “A fine Lion you
are, to be frightened of a Mouse.” “This not the Mouse I fear,” said the
Lion; “I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding.”</strong></p>
<p>Little liberties are great offenses.</p>
